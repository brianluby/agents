- **Model**: sonnet
- **Purpose**: Visual regression testing and UI validation
- **Key Features**: Screenshot analysis, design system compliance
- **Recommendation**: Import to `visual-tools/` folder

## Structural Improvements Found

### 1. **Enhanced Agent Metadata**
wshobson's agents have more detailed front matter sections:
- **Purpose Section**: Clear, dedicated purpose statement
- **Capabilities Section**: Detailed capability breakdown with subsections
- **Behavioral Traits**: Some agents include personality/approach traits
- **Knowledge Base**: References to specific tools and frameworks

### 2. **Better Agent Differentiation**
- **"When to Use vs [Other Agent]" Sections**: Clear delineation between similar agents
- Example: backend-security-coder vs security-auditor distinction
- Helps prevent agent confusion and improves selection

### 3. **More Comprehensive Prompts**
- Longer, more detailed system prompts (avg 200+ lines vs our 50-100 lines)
- Structured with clear sections: Purpose, Capabilities, Approach, Output
- More specific technical details and framework references

### 4. **Flat Structure Considerations**
**Pros of their approach:**
- Simpler to browse all agents
- No category confusion
- Easier to search/grep

**Cons:**
- Less organized for large collections
- Harder to find related agents
- No clear taxonomy

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Imports (High Value Additions)
1. Import all security-coder agents (backend, frontend, mobile)
2. Import tdd-orchestrator for comprehensive TDD support
3. Consider django-pro and fastapi-pro for framework-specific needs

### Structural Enhancements to Consider
1. **Add Purpose Section**: Clear one-paragraph purpose to all agents
2. **Add "When to Use" Guidelines**: For agents with overlapping responsibilities
3. **Enhance Capabilities Sections**: More detailed capability breakdowns
4. **Consider Behavioral Traits**: Add personality/approach for complex agents

### Maintain Our Advantages
- Keep category folder structure for better organization
- Continue using tags for cross-category discovery
- Maintain consistent model selection strategy

## Summary

The wshobson/agents repository offers 8 valuable new agents not present in our collection, particularly strong in security-specific coding (vs auditing) and TDD orchestration. Their agents feature more detailed structure with clear purpose statements, capability breakdowns, and "when to use" guidelines that could enhance our existing agents. While their flat file structure is simpler, our categorized approach provides better organization for a large agent collection.
