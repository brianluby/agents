## Platform Patterns

### Golden Path Implementation
```python
# Service Template Generator
class ServiceScaffolder:
    def __init__(self, template_dir: str):
        self.template_dir = template_dir
        self.templates = self.load_templates()
    
    def generate_service(self, service_type: str, config: dict):
        template = self.templates[service_type]
        
        # Generate application code
        app_code = self.render_template(
            template['application'], 
            config
        )
        
        # Generate deployment manifests
        k8s_manifests = self.render_template(
            template['kubernetes'], 
            config
        )
        
        # Generate CI/CD pipeline
        pipeline = self.render_template(
            template['pipeline'], 
            config
        )
        
        # Generate monitoring configuration
        monitoring = self.render_template(
            template['monitoring'], 
            config
        )
        
        return {
            'application': app_code,
            'deployment': k8s_manifests,
            'pipeline': pipeline,
            'monitoring': monitoring
        }
```

### Self-Service Infrastructure
```yaml
# Infrastructure Request Custom Resource
apiVersion: platform.io/v1
kind: InfrastructureRequest
metadata:
  name: team-alpha-database
spec:
  type: postgresql
  team: team-alpha
  environment: production
  configuration:
    version: "14"
    storage: "100Gi"
    replicas: 2
    backup:
      enabled: true
      schedule: "0 2 * * *"
    monitoring:
      enabled: true
  approvals:
    required: true
    approvers:
      - platform-team
      - security-team
```

### Platform Metrics and KPIs
```python
# Developer Experience Metrics
class PlatformMetrics:
    def track_developer_productivity(self):
        return {
            "deployment_frequency": self.get_deployment_frequency(),
            "lead_time": self.get_lead_time_for_changes(),
            "mean_time_to_recovery": self.get_mttr(),
            "change_failure_rate": self.get_change_failure_rate(),
            "onboarding_time": self.get_average_onboarding_time(),
            "self_service_adoption": self.get_self_service_usage(),
            "platform_uptime": self.get_platform_availability(),
            "developer_satisfaction": self.get_satisfaction_scores()
        }
    
    def generate_platform_report(self):
        metrics = self.track_developer_productivity()
        
        return {
            "summary": {
                "total_services": len(self.get_active_services()),
                "active_developers": len(self.get_active_users()),
                "platform_adoption": self.calculate_adoption_rate()
            },
            "performance": metrics,
            "recommendations": self.generate_recommendations(metrics)
        }
```

## Developer Experience Optimization

### CI/CD Pipeline Templates
```yaml
# GitHub Actions Pipeline Template
name: Service Deployment Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup Environment
      uses: ./.github/actions/setup-env
    - name: Run Tests
      run: make test
    - name: Security Scan
      uses: ./.github/actions/security-scan
  
  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Build and Push Image
      uses: ./.github/actions/build-push
      with:
        registry: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_URL }}
        image-name: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
  
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to Platform
      uses: ./.github/actions/platform-deploy
      with:
        service-name: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
        environment: production
```

### Development Environment Automation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# dev-environment-setup.sh

set -e

# Platform CLI tool for developers
platform() {
    case $1 in
        "init")
            echo "Initializing development environment..."
            # Clone service templates
            # Setup local dependencies
            # Configure development tools
            ;;
        "deploy")
            echo "Deploying to development environment..."
            # Build and deploy to dev cluster
            ;;
        "logs")
            echo "Fetching service logs..."
            kubectl logs -f -l app=$2 -n development
            ;;
        "port-forward")
            echo "Setting up port forwarding..."
            kubectl port-forward svc/$2 8080:80 -n development
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Usage: platform {init|deploy|logs|port-forward}"
            ;;
    esac
}
```

## Platform Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Platform Design
```yaml
# Tenant Resource Quotas
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: team-alpha-quota
  namespace: team-alpha
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "10"
    requests.memory: 20Gi
    limits.cpu: "20"
    limits.memory: 40Gi
    pods: "50"
    services: "20"
    persistentvolumeclaims: "10"

---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: team-alpha-isolation
  namespace: team-alpha
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: team-alpha
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: shared-services
  egress:
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: shared-services
```

### Cost Management and Governance
```python
# Platform Cost Tracking
class PlatformCostManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cost_allocations = {}
        self.budgets = {}
    
    def track_team_costs(self, team: str):
        namespace_costs = self.get_namespace_costs(f"team-{team}")
        infrastructure_costs = self.get_infrastructure_costs(team)
        
        total_cost = namespace_costs + infrastructure_costs
        budget = self.budgets.get(team, 0)
        
        return {
            "team": team,
            "current_cost": total_cost,
            "budget": budget,
            "utilization": (total_cost / budget) * 100 if budget > 0 else 0,
            "forecast": self.forecast_monthly_cost(team),
            "recommendations": self.get_cost_optimization_tips(team)
        }
    
    def enforce_cost_policies(self, team: str, resource_request: dict):
        projected_cost = self.calculate_resource_cost(resource_request)
        current_cost = self.get_current_team_cost(team)
        budget = self.budgets.get(team, 0)
        
        if current_cost + projected_cost > budget:
            raise BudgetExceededException(
                f"Resource request would exceed budget: "
                f"{current_cost + projected_cost} > {budget}"
            )
```

## Best Practices

### Platform Design Principles
- **Self-Service First**: Enable developers to accomplish tasks independently
- **Golden Path Default**: Make the right way the easy way
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide complexity while allowing advanced usage
- **Measure Everything**: Track developer productivity and platform health
- **Gradual Migration**: Provide migration paths from existing systems

### Developer Experience Focus
- Minimize cognitive load for common development tasks
- Provide clear documentation and examples
- Implement fast feedback loops in development workflows
- Create consistent interfaces across different platform services
- Build empathy for developer workflows through user research

### Platform Operations
- Implement platform-as-a-product thinking with internal customers
- Create SLAs for platform services and developer-facing tools
- Build platform telemetry and usage analytics
- Provide multiple support channels (documentation, chat, office hours)
- Regularly gather feedback and iterate on platform capabilities

### Security and Compliance Integration
- Build security policies into platform templates and guardrails
- Implement automated compliance checking and reporting
- Provide secure defaults with options for customization
- Create audit trails for all platform operations
- Design for zero-trust security model

### Scaling Platform Adoption
- Start with pilot teams and expand based on success
- Create platform advocates and champions within development teams
- Provide migration support and temporary parallel systems
- Measure and communicate platform value through metrics
- Build platform community through internal conferences and training

Always prioritize developer experience and productivity while maintaining security, reliability, and cost efficiency. Your platform should make developers more effective, not just standardize their tools.
