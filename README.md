## Installation

### For Claude Code

**Note**: Claude Code expects agents directly in `~/.claude/agents/`, not in subdirectories. See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed setup options.

Quick setup with symlink:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brianluby/agents.git ~/agents-repo
ln -s ~/agents-repo/claude ~/.claude/agents
```

### For OpenCode

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/brianluby/agents.git

# Link OpenCode agents globally
ln -s /path/to/agents/opencode/* ~/.config/opencode/agent/

# Or link to a project
ln -s /path/to/agents/opencode/* .opencode/agent/
```

See [OPENCODE.md](OPENCODE.md) for detailed OpenCode setup instructions.

### Linting Agents

Validate agent metadata before committing:
```bash
python scripts/lint_agents.py --roots opencode claude --require-model
```
Auto-fill missing model values:
```bash
python scripts/lint_agents.py --roots opencode --fix-missing-model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```
Auto-fix canonical key ordering & validate allowed tools:
```bash
python scripts/lint_agents.py --roots opencode claude --check-order --require-model
```
Soft (non-failing) report mode:
```bash
python scripts/lint_agents.py --roots opencode --require-model --warn-only
```
Install pre-commit hook:
```bash
ln -s ../../.githooks/agent-lint .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
See CHANGELOG.md for normalization history.

## Usage

### Automatic Delegation
Claude Code automatically selects the appropriate subagent based on task context and requirements. The system analyzes your request and delegates to the most suitable specialist.

### Explicit Invocation
Specify a subagent by name to use a particular specialist:

```
"Use code-reviewer to analyze the recent changes"
"Have security-auditor scan for vulnerabilities"
"Get performance-engineer to optimize this bottleneck"
```

## Usage Examples

### Code Quality & Security
```
code-reviewer: Analyze component for best practices
security-auditor: Check for OWASP compliance
tdd-orchestrator: Implement feature with test-first approach
performance-engineer: Profile and optimize bottlenecks
```

### Development & Architecture
```
backend-architect: Design authentication API
frontend-developer: Create responsive dashboard
graphql-architect: Design federated GraphQL schema
mobile-developer: Build cross-platform mobile app
```

### Infrastructure & Operations
```
devops-troubleshooter: Analyze production logs
cloud-architect: Design scalable AWS architecture
network-engineer: Debug SSL certificate issues
database-admin: Configure backup and replication
terraform-specialist: Write infrastructure modules
```

### Data & Machine Learning
```
data-scientist: Analyze customer behavior dataset
ai-engineer: Build RAG system for document search
mlops-engineer: Set up experiment tracking
ml-engineer: Deploy model to production
```

### Business & Documentation
```
business-analyst: Create metrics dashboard
docs-architect: Generate technical documentation
api-documenter: Write OpenAPI specifications
content-marketer: Create SEO-optimized content
```

## Multi-Agent Workflows

Subagents coordinate automatically for complex tasks. The system intelligently sequences multiple specialists based on task requirements.

### Common Workflow Patterns

**Feature Development**
```
"Implement user authentication"
‚Üí backend-architect ‚Üí frontend-developer ‚Üí test-automator ‚Üí security-auditor
```

**Performance Optimization**
```
"Optimize checkout process"
‚Üí performance-engineer ‚Üí database-optimizer ‚Üí frontend-developer
```

**Production Incidents**
```
"Debug high memory usage"
‚Üí incident-responder ‚Üí devops-troubleshooter ‚Üí error-detective ‚Üí performance-engineer
```

**Infrastructure Setup**
```
"Set up disaster recovery"
‚Üí database-admin ‚Üí database-optimizer ‚Üí terraform-specialist
```

**ML Pipeline Development**
```
"Build ML pipeline with monitoring"
‚Üí mlops-engineer ‚Üí ml-engineer ‚Üí data-engineer ‚Üí performance-engineer
```

### Integration with Claude Code Commands

For sophisticated multi-agent orchestration, use the [Claude Code Commands](https://github.com/brianluby/commands) collection which provides 52 pre-built slash commands:

```
/full-stack-feature   # Coordinates 8+ agents for complete feature development
/incident-response    # Activates incident management workflow
/ml-pipeline         # Sets up end-to-end ML infrastructure
/security-hardening  # Implements security best practices across stack
```

## Subagent Format

Each subagent is defined as a Markdown file with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: Activation criteria for this subagent
model: haiku|sonnet|opus  # Optional: Model selection
tools: tool1, tool2       # Optional: Tool restrictions
---

System prompt defining the subagent's expertise and behavior
```

### Model Selection Criteria

- **haiku**: Simple, deterministic tasks with minimal reasoning
- **sonnet**: Standard development and engineering tasks
- **opus**: Complex analysis, architecture, and critical operations

## Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Processing
Agents execute in sequence, passing context forward:
```
backend-architect ‚Üí frontend-developer ‚Üí test-automator ‚Üí security-auditor
```

### Parallel Execution
Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects:
```
performance-engineer + database-optimizer ‚Üí Merged analysis
```

### Conditional Routing
Dynamic agent selection based on analysis:
```
debugger ‚Üí [backend-architect | frontend-developer | devops-troubleshooter]
```

### Validation Pipeline
Primary work followed by specialized review:
```
payment-integration ‚Üí security-auditor ‚Üí Validated implementation
```

2. **Clear requirements** - Specify constraints, tech stack, and quality standards
3. **Trust specialization** - Each agent is optimized for their specific domain

### Multi-Agent Workflows
1. **High-level requests** - Allow agents to coordinate complex multi-step tasks
2. **Context preservation** - Ensure agents have necessary background information
3. **Integration review** - Verify how different agents' outputs work together

### Explicit Control
1. **Direct invocation** - Specify agents when you need particular expertise
2. **Strategic combination** - Use multiple specialists for validation
3. **Review patterns** - Request specific review workflows (e.g., "security-auditor reviews API design")

### Performance Optimization
1. **Monitor effectiveness** - Track which agents work best for your use cases
2. **Iterative refinement** - Use agent feedback to improve requirements
3. **Complexity matching** - Align task complexity with agent capabilities

## Contributing

To add a new subagent:

1. Create a new `.md` file with appropriate frontmatter
2. Use lowercase, hyphen-separated naming convention
3. Write clear activation criteria in the description
4. Define comprehensive system prompt with expertise areas

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Activating
- Ensure request clearly indicates the domain
- Be specific about task type and requirements
- Use explicit invocation if automatic selection fails

### Unexpected Agent Selection
- Provide more context about tech stack
- Include specific requirements in request
- Use direct agent naming for precise control

### Conflicting Recommendations
- Normal behavior - specialists have different priorities
- Request reconciliation between specific agents
- Consider trade-offs based on project requirements

### Missing Context
- Include background information in requests
- Reference previous work or patterns
- Provide project-specific constraints
