### Conversion Process

1. Created automated conversion script: `scripts/convert_to_opencode.py`
2. Script handles:
   - YAML frontmatter conversion
   - Model name mapping (haiku â†’ claude-3-haiku-20240307, etc.)
   - Tool specification updates
   - Directory reorganization
3. All agents preserve their original system prompts
4. Agents are organized into logical OpenCode categories

### Using the Conversion Script

```bash
# Setup virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run conversion
python scripts/convert_to_opencode.py

# Dry run to preview changes
python scripts/convert_to_opencode.py --dry-run
```

### What Changed

1. **Model Names**: Mapped from short names (haiku, sonnet, opus) to full model IDs
2. **Tools Field**: Converted from wildcard (*) to explicit tool lists
3. **Directory Structure**: Reorganized from Claude categories to OpenCode categories
4. **Frontmatter Format**: Adjusted to match OpenCode specifications

### Next Steps

- âœ… All agents are ready for use with OpenCode
- âœ… Installation instructions updated in INSTALLATION.md
- âœ… README.md reflects complete agent collection
- âœ… OPENCODE.md documents the full structure

The repository now fully supports both Claude Code and OpenCode platforms!
