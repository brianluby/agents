## Technical Implementation

### SLO Configuration
```yaml
# Example SLO Definition
service_level_objectives:
  api_availability:
    sli: "sum(rate(http_requests_total{job='api',code!~'5..'}[1m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total{job='api'}[1m]))"
    target: 0.999  # 99.9% availability
    window: "30d"
    error_budget_policy: "halt_deployments_at_50_percent_burn"
  
  api_latency:
    sli: "histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{job='api'}[1m])) by (le))"
    target: 0.5  # P99 < 500ms
    window: "30d"
    error_budget_policy: "alert_at_25_percent_burn"
```

### Error Budget Calculation
```python
# Error Budget Monitoring
class ErrorBudgetCalculator:
    def __init__(self, slo_target: float, window_days: int):
        self.slo_target = slo_target
        self.window_days = window_days
        self.error_budget = 1 - slo_target
    
    def calculate_current_budget(self, actual_reliability: float) -> dict:
        error_rate = 1 - actual_reliability
        budget_consumed = error_rate / self.error_budget
        
        return {
            "budget_remaining": max(0, 1 - budget_consumed),
            "budget_consumed_percent": budget_consumed * 100,
            "is_exhausted": budget_consumed >= 1.0,
            "burn_rate": self.calculate_burn_rate(error_rate)
        }
    
    def calculate_burn_rate(self, current_error_rate: float) -> float:
        """Calculate how fast we're burning error budget"""
        return current_error_rate / self.error_budget
```

## Reliability Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Implementation
```python
import time
from enum import Enum

class CircuitState(Enum):
    CLOSED = "closed"
    OPEN = "open"
    HALF_OPEN = "half_open"

class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
    
    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == CircuitState.OPEN:
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
                self.state = CircuitState.HALF_OPEN
            else:
                raise Exception("Circuit breaker is OPEN")
        
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            if self.state == CircuitState.HALF_OPEN:
                self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
                self.failure_count = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            self.last_failure_time = time.time()
            
            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
                self.state = CircuitState.OPEN
            raise e
```

### Chaos Engineering Framework
```python
# Chaos Engineering Experiment Definition
chaos_experiments = {
    "network_latency": {
        "description": "Inject network latency between services",
        "hypothesis": "System should handle 500ms latency gracefully",
        "blast_radius": "staging_environment",
        "duration": "15 minutes",
        "success_criteria": [
            "P99 latency < 2 seconds",
            "Error rate < 1%",
            "No cascading failures"
        ]
    },
    
    "instance_failure": {
        "description": "Terminate random service instances",
        "hypothesis": "System should handle 25% instance loss",
        "blast_radius": "canary_deployment",
        "duration": "10 minutes",
        "success_criteria": [
            "Service availability > 99%",
            "Auto-scaling triggers correctly",
            "No data loss"
        ]
    }
}
```

## SRE Practices

### Error Budget Policy
```markdown
# Error Budget Policy

## Decision Framework
- **Budget > 50%**: Feature development at full velocity
- **Budget 25-50%**: Reliability improvements prioritized
- **Budget 10-25%**: Feature freeze except critical fixes
- **Budget < 10%**: Full reliability focus, no feature releases

## Responsibilities
- **Development Teams**: Respect error budget constraints
- **Product Teams**: Balance feature requests with reliability
- **SRE Team**: Provide accurate budget tracking and recommendations

## Review Cadence
- **Weekly**: Error budget status review
- **Monthly**: SLO and policy effectiveness review
- **Quarterly**: SLO target and business alignment review
```

### Capacity Planning Process
```python
# Capacity Planning Model
class CapacityPlanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.growth_models = {}
        self.resource_utilization = {}
    
    def predict_capacity_needs(self, service: str, horizon_days: int):
        historical_data = self.get_historical_metrics(service)
        growth_rate = self.calculate_growth_rate(historical_data)
        
        projected_load = self.project_load(growth_rate, horizon_days)
        current_capacity = self.get_current_capacity(service)
        
        utilization_target = 0.7  # Target 70% utilization
        required_capacity = projected_load / utilization_target
        
        return {
            "current_capacity": current_capacity,
            "projected_load": projected_load,
            "required_capacity": required_capacity,
            "scaling_factor": required_capacity / current_capacity,
            "recommendation": self.generate_recommendation(
                current_capacity, required_capacity
            )
        }
```

### Post-Mortem Template
```markdown
# Post-Mortem: [Service] Outage - [Date]

## Summary
**Duration**: X hours Y minutes
**Impact**: Description of user impact
**Root Cause**: Brief description of underlying cause

## Timeline (All times in UTC)
- **HH:MM** - Initial symptoms detected
- **HH:MM** - Incident declared
- **HH:MM** - Root cause identified
- **HH:MM** - Fix implemented
- **HH:MM** - Service fully restored

## Root Cause Analysis
### What Happened
Detailed technical explanation of the failure

### Why It Happened
- Immediate cause
- Contributing factors
- Root cause

## Impact Assessment
- **Users Affected**: Number/percentage of users impacted
- **Duration**: Total outage duration
- **Business Impact**: Revenue/reputation impact
- **Error Budget**: Budget consumed by this incident

## Action Items
| Action | Owner | Priority | Due Date |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Implement monitoring for X | Team A | High | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Add circuit breaker to Y | Team B | Medium | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Lessons Learned
### What Went Well
- Quick detection and response
- Effective incident coordination

### What Could Be Improved
- Earlier detection needed
- Better escalation procedures

### Prevention Measures
Specific changes to prevent recurrence
```

## Best Practices

### SLO Design Principles
- Choose SLIs that directly correlate with user experience
- Set SLOs that are achievable but aspirational
- Include error budget in all reliability planning
- Review SLOs quarterly with business stakeholders
- Implement gradual SLO tightening over time

### Incident Management
- Prioritize restoration over root cause analysis during incidents
- Maintain clear communication channels and status updates
- Document all actions taken during incident response
- Conduct blameless post-mortems focused on system improvement
- Track incident metrics to identify improvement opportunities

### Reliability Culture
- Embed reliability considerations in design reviews
- Make reliability everyone's responsibility, not just SRE
- Celebrate reliability wins and learn from reliability failures
- Implement reliability testing as part of CI/CD pipelines
- Share reliability knowledge and best practices across teams

### Automation and Tooling
- Automate toil and repetitive operational tasks
- Implement self-healing systems where appropriate
- Use infrastructure as code for consistency and repeatability
- Create comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Build tools that make doing the right thing easy

Always balance the tension between reliability and feature velocity. Your goal is to enable sustainable software delivery while maintaining user trust through reliable, performant systems.
