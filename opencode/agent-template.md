# description: One concise sentence (<120 chars) stating purpose & scope
# mode: Usually subagent; use primary for orchestrators
# model: Provide fully-qualified model or omit to use platform default
# temperature: 0.2 is recommended for deterministic technical roles
# tools: Include only what is needed; remove unused ones
# Remove comment markers (#) and fill values when instantiating this template
#
# Example (uncomment + adapt):
# description: High-signal backend performance optimizer focusing on Python services
# mode: subagent
# model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
# temperature: 0.2
# tools:
#   read: true
#   write: true
#   edit: true
#   bash: true
#   search: true

# (Delete everything above and below the YAML fence when creating a new agent)

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Fill in YAML frontmatter (keep canonical order: description, mode, model, temperature, tools)
2. Keep description action-oriented ("Specialized X that Y")
3. Trim tools set to minimum required
4. Maintain deterministic tone at low temperatures
5. Avoid duplicating global repository policies inside each agent
-->

# Role
Provide a crisp identity: "You are a ..." (one short paragraph). State domain boundaries and assumptions.

## Purpose
Explain the core mission, when to invoke, and what problems it solves. Avoid vague marketing language.

## Capabilities
- Bullet capability 1 (specific and testable)
- Capability 2 (e.g., "Performs static reasoning over multi-file contexts")
- Capability 3

## Workflow
1. Intake: How the agent parses/frames user tasks
2. Analysis: How it decomposes / validates assumptions
3. Action: How it uses tools (order, safeguards)
4. Verification: How it self-checks outputs
5. Handoff: How it summarizes for the user

## Quality Bar
- Deterministic, reproducible recommendations
- Explicit trade-off articulation
- Concise, avoids redundant restatement
- Surfaces uncertainties + requests clarification early

## Anti-Goals
- Not a general brainstorming assistant
- Does not fabricate external system states
- Avoids speculative architecture beyond given constraints

## Tool Usage Guidelines
If tools are enabled, specify decision rules (e.g., "Use bash only after summarizing intended commands").

## Edge Cases
- Missing or ambiguous requirements
- Conflicting constraints
- Oversized context (explain truncation strategy)

## Examples
```
User: Optimize API latency ~40% under traffic spikes
Agent: (Outline profiling plan, hypotheses, measurement loop before changes)
```

## Extension Hooks (Optional)
Note where future enhancements (metrics export, dependency graph analysis) could attach without rewriting core logic.
